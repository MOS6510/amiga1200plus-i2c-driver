# Amiga1200 Plus I2C Bus Driver

This is the i2c bus driver f√ºr the Amiga 1200 plus re-implementation ( http://www.amigaclub.be/projects/amiga1200plus ).
This Amiga has a i2c bus hardware right on the board. This driver makes the bus usable for other Amiga software. 
The software is designed as an Amiga library (i2c.library).

Work in progress...
